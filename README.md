- [DEMO LINK](https://nub1a.github.io/foodify_application/)
## Used technologies:
- ReactJS
- React Hooks
- React Router(Hash)
- Fetch, Promise
- CSS

## Description

You need to create an application which will allow the user to get a random recipe and give him / her an ability to save it in the favorite dishes list.
- Call the API endpoint “https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php” to fetch a random recipe and display it on the main page.
- Add an ability to save or skip current recipes.
- Saved recipes should be displayed on the other page (for example favorite recipes) and will persist their state after reloading the page.
- Implement a modal window with form on the favorite recipes page to allow the user create his / her own recipes. Each recipe has to include a title and a cooking instruction.

## Task requirements
- You should use React for this app.
- API should be called once on page load, skip button should refetch random data from API
- You can use any state manager you want or not use it at all
- When you add custom dish, or when API has no image, you should show placeholder
- Design is up to you
- You can use any styling solution you want (sass, styled-components, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind)
- You can use UI libraries
- Your app should be responsive and be able to adopt to mobile devices
- Storing data in local-storage will be a plus
- App should be stored on public github repo
- You should use gh-pages to host your project
- Make sure you provide both github and gh-pages links to our HR, when you finish the project
